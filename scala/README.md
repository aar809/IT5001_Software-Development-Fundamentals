# IT5001_Software-Development-Fundamentals

The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate working knowledge of Scala programming language, using OOP principles to solve the "cruises" problem statement. 

Task
Write a program that reads in the number of cruises in the schedule as an integer, and a list of cruises that will arrive for that day.
The program will output
• The number of normal cruises
• The number of big cruises
• The number of loaders required
• The loader allocation schedule
Do note the following assumptions:
• Input cruises are presented chronologically by arrival time
• There are up to 30 cruises in one day with no duplicates.

Full instructions can be found in "Scala+OOP+Assignment" file.

(Note - DO NOT reference or copy any of the code contents if you are a current student of this class or doing the same assignment.)
